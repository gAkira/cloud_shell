# 06 October 2023
- Download all the given files for the project
- Tried to install all the stack to work on the project
- Read Makefile and tried to understand it
- Not sure why 'make' is not working

# 09 October 2023
- Figured out how to install the toolchain properly (there is a small link on
  the bottom of the arm webpage that leads to a documentation)
- 'make' is still not working... It says that qemu is not installed, even
  though I've installed it and its dependencies

# 10 October 2023
- I have just noticed that I was trying to install the qemu from the apt-get
  package manager, so it was the normal one... not the qemu-system-arm.
- Read the vector.s, reset.s and main.c
- Edited the main.c in order to stop the printing of "Zzzzz..." 

# 15 October 2023
- Read the documentation of the qemu and changed Makefile to make it launch
  a second serial telnet
- Found out how to reach qemu and send command to it (ctrl+a c) and started to
  dig in its functionalities (the meaning of C-a c is not so obvious...)

# 20 October 2023
- Implemented the function kputchar in the file kprintf.c
- Added kprintf.o to the list of objects in Makefile, in order to make it
  compile the kprintf.c file
- Changed a little bit main.c and showed that the kprintf is working (writing
  to the telnet terminal)

# 24 October 2023
- Found about ANSI escape sequences (https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797)
- Tested some functionalities (like "\e[2J" to erase the whole screen)
- Started to implement some basic functionalities of libc in cc_libc (such as memcpy, memmove, etc)

# 27 October 2023
- Started to write some functions to encapsulate ANSI functionalites in utils.c/utils.h
- Tried to understand more about the libraries provided (using flags -lc to try to link to libc in compilation)

# 31 October 2023
- Implemented some other functions to utils.c
- Implemented a printf (cc_printf) based on the kprintf implementation
- Defined the behavior of the default switch in main

# 01 November 2023
- Added more functions to utils.c and to cc_libc.c
- Found out that the backspace key in keyboard actually throws the DEL code
- Implemented the functionality of the backspace (DEL code)

# 09 November 2023
- Created the 'skeleton' of the \r\n functionality (jump line, save in history and execute command)
- Function execute already handles the 'reset' command
- Noticed that the cursor origin position is actually at (1, 1) and not (0, 0)... what was generating some bugs

# 13 November 2023
- Created a Finite State Machine (FSM) to handle special keys such as the arrow keys and delete... kinda tough...

# 16 November 2023
- Implemented the history functionality (up and down arrows)
- Needed to update the way I handled the \r\n

# 17 November 2023
- Implemented the 'echo' command
- Tested everything to make sure the project is working fine
